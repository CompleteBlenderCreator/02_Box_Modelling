### Section 2 Introduction ###

+ We're excited to see how you will change.
+ We'll be exploring the fundamentals of Blender.
+ Vertices: points in space.
+ Edges: lines between vertices.
+ Faces: closed polygons of edges.
+ By the end you'll be making simple placeholder assets.

### Your Section 2 Assets ###

+ This is the Lecture where you will find all of file you will need to complete the Section.
+ Please Download your Asset Pack now.
+ Your files will come in a Zip file ready for extraction to your computer.

### Basic Modelling Concepts ###

Michael goes through some basic modelling concepts on a whiteboard.

### Vertices, Edges and Faces ###

+ Learn about Object Mode and Edit Mode.
+ Naming your meshes.
+ Manipulate Vertices, Edges and Faces.
+ Understand their relationship.

### Making A Wedge Shape ###

Here Michael shows you how to make a basic wedge shape.

### Moving, Rotating and Resizing ###

+ How to control your model with more precision.
+ Blender's co-ordinate system.
+ Co-ordinates are always listed as (X,Y,Z).

### Pivot Points ###

+ We’ll take a closer look at pivot points.
+ How to change them.
+ Things to watch out for.

### Duplication and Merging ###

+ Learn about Duplication.
+ Create one mesh from multiple objects.

### Version Control ###

+ What is Version Control?
+ Why you would want to do this.
+ How to change Blender's Save Versions.
+ Your Other Options

### Merging Vertices in Blender ###

+ Explore Wireframe Mode.
+ How to merge 2 vertices into one.
+ Why you would want to do this.
+ How to control the sensitivity of the merge.

### What Are Normals? ###

+ "Normal" means 90-degrees
+ Normals are vectors at 90-degrees to the faces.
+ Think of them like hairs.
+ Hairs should grow outwards!

### Normals in Blender ###

+ Learn about Normals.
+ Why they're are important.
+ How to fix them if they have gone wrong.

### Extruding In Blender ###

+ What exuding is.
+ Planning your model.
+ How it applies to Faces, Edges and Vertices.

### Insetting in Blender ###

+ Learn how to use the Inset Tool.
+ Using the Outset Option.

### Insetting Question for YOU! ###

Michael asks a quick question for your feedback on keyboard shortcuts.

### Edge Loops, Loop Cut and Slide ###

+ What edge loops are.
+ How to select an edge loop.
+ Show the power of loop cut.
+ How to control the slide function.

### Different Selection Methods ###

+ Learn more ways to select your geometry.
+ Border select.
+ Circle select.

### The Snapping Tool ###

+ Learn another way to constrain movement.
+ Using the Snapping Tool.
+ How to snap objects into place.
+ Control whether or not you merge vertices.

### Extra Challenge- "Railings" ###

Here we combine the knowledge we have learnt so far to complete an extra
challenge.

### Using The Array Modifier ###

+ Your first modifier: The Array Modifier
+ They're non destructive… Until you apply them!
+ How to separate your geometry.

### Loop Cuts and Face Loops ###

+ Build on your knowledge of Loop Cutting.
+ How Face Loops are similar to Edge Loops.

### Subdivision ###

+ What subdivision is.
+ The dangers of subdivision.

### Coordinate Systems & Exporting ###

+ A useful export checklist.
+ Introducing left and right handed coordinates.
+ Demonstrating an import into Unity.
+ Where do you want to export to first?

### Applying Transforms ###

+ Editing an object and transforming an object can look the same.
+ Transforms aren’t applied by default.
+ Not applying transforms can impact animation, particles systems, physics,
beveling, modifiers….

### Extra Modelling Challenges ###

+ We now have a lot of basic modelling tools to hand.
+ It’s time to re-enforce our modelling knowledge.

### Section 2 Wrap Up ###

+ Well done getting this far.
+ Please remember to share in the Discussions.
+ Try making your own boat, house and tree.
+ Start the next section now!
